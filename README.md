# Deep Learning Projects Collection

This repository showcases a collection of projects exploring various deep learning architectures and techniques across image classification, object detection, image generation, and natural language processing. Each project emphasizes different aspects of deep learning, from understanding model architectures to preprocessing data and evaluating model performance.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Image Classification with CNNs

- **Objective**: Explore CNN architectures for classifying images into categories (airplanes, buses, cats, dogs, pizzas).
- **Insights**: Demonstrated the impact of padding and depth on classification accuracy.

### 2. Creating Your Own Object Detection Dataset

- **Objective**: Develop a custom dataset for object detection.
- **Insights**: Quality data curation is crucial for object detection models' performance.

### 3. Object Detection with YOLO

- **Objective**: Implement the YOLO model for object detection.
- **Insights**: YOLO efficiently processes real-time data, with challenges in detecting small objects and reducing false positives.

### 4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Image Generation

- **Objective**: Generate realistic images using GANs, focusing on pizza images.
- **Insights**: GANs can produce high-quality images, with architectural variations affecting image fidelity.

### 5. Sentiment Analysis with GRUs

- **Objective**: Conduct sentiment analysis using GRUs.
- **Insights**: GRUs are effective in capturing temporal dependencies in text data for sentiment classification.

### 6. Exploring Vision Transformers (ViTs) for Image Classification

- **Objective**: Apply ViTs for image classification and compare their performance against CNNs.
- **Insights**: ViTs show promise in leveraging global context for classification, though they may require more data and resources.
